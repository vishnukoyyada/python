"""
Generally some  languages handle function arguments as references to existing variables, 
which is known as pass by reference. 
Other languages handle them as independent values, an approach known as pass by value.

"""
Python has a  peculiar way of handling function arguments.
Python’s argument passing model is neither “Pass by Value” nor “Pass by Reference” but it is 
“Pass by Object Reference”.
