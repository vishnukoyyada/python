#bitonic array means first it will increases monotomicaly and then decreases montomicaly
"""
what is mean by monotomical array?

it array of element != array of next incresing element 
its like 5,9,7,8,9,12

it wont be like 5,5,8,9,12,12
"""
"""
So,bitonic  means it will increses first monotomicaly after decreses monotomicaly

example:
 [1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, 11, 7, 2, -4, -9] -> It monotonically increases from 1 to 14, then decreases from 14 to -9.

"""

"""
As its a monotonicaly decreasing it  wont increase again after one peak element .
So,in bitonic array there will be only one peak element
