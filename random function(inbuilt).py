"""
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, 
but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
"""
#For example,import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:
import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))
"""
output:
it can be any nummber in b/w 1-10
