taken the range upto sqrt(n) because after that all the values will be cofactors from the begging
example n=11
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
now the square root of 11 is 3 
S0 if we check 11%2,11%3 then its not necessary to check with the factors of 2 till 11 they are 2,4,6,8,10
                       and also its not necessary to check with the factors of 3 till 11 they are 6,9
